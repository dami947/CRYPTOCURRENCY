                            best options for anyone interested in cryptocurrencies.

                            Like the name suggests, a crypto wallet is an application that stores, sends and receives
                            crypto coins. You can think of it like you would a leather wallet full of physical cash, and
                            basically, that’s all you need to use cryptocurrencies.

                            The most common wallets are smartphone-based and use the device’s camera to scan QR codes to
                            save the user from needing to copy/paste long addresses. Other people have desktop versions
                            or use browser-based wallets. To the end user, the interface is similar, though the way they
                            function and handle private keys (the ‘key’ which allow you to spend your bitcoins) and user
                            privacy can be very different.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-info">
                        <p class="text-bottom">Every coin address contains both a public and a private key. The public
                            key allows others to send coins to your address, and verifies the signature of the
                            transaction to ensure everything is in order and finalizes the transaction. The private key,
                            on the other hand, allows you to ‘unlock’ and spend your coins. It does this by signing
                            transactions, which tells the cryptocurrency network that you are indeed the owner of the
                            address in which the bitcoins are held and that the transaction is valid. Whoever holds the
                            private key for a coin address is able to spend the bitcoins which that address holds, so in
                            a very fitting analogy, your private key is essentially the key to the safe which is holding
                            your coins. You can also use the private key of an address to sign a message, verifying that
                            you are the owner of the coins held at any given address. This is all secured through
                            mathematics, using asymmetric cryptography.</p>

                        <p class="text-bottom">It is very easy for any merchant to accept Bitcoin, and most of the time
                            preparing to add the feature to your payment services takes less than 10 minutes. Merchants
                            can accept Bitcoin both online and at physical locations by using a merchant service payment
                            provider like Bitpay, or even just using a simple wallet address generated on their own
                            device. Bitcoin has significantly lower fees than PayPal, credit card companies and bank
                            services making it far more appealing to store owners than the legacy payment card
                            processors. The cryptocurrency is also irreversible so chargebacks are not possible, and
                            this leaves the decision to refund fully within the hands of the store owner. Merchants can
                            accept Bitcoin through a payment processor, through a Point-Of-Sale (POS) device or simply
                            using their own tablet or smartphone. Adding Bitcoin as a payment method for your store can
                            also increase your customer base for those who like to pay with cryptocurrency as well as
                            broadening your company’s reach into the global market. Read more about merchant solutions
